# ML-project
# Binary classification

## Brief description

In this project, we aim to apply different machine learning models onto two different datasets for binary classification. However, our scripts 
are factorized a minimim possible and can be applied to different datasets.

## Methodology

### Preprocessing

* Loads datasets
* Cleans data
* Splits datasets into training and test datasets
* Additionnaly to cleaned data, outputs datasets on which we operated either tsne or PCA


### Classification models comparison


We compare the performance of different models on the test datasets.
The models are: CART, KNN, SVM and Log regression


### Improved Classifiers

Contains the following models:
* SVM
* KNN 
* Log regression
* Stochastic gradient descent
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest

Here, we improve our models by looking for the parameters that maximize the accuracy across multiple validation sets.
