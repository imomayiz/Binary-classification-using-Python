# ML-project
# Binary classification

##Brief description

In this project, we aim to apply different machine learning models onto two different datasets for binary classification. However, our scripts 
are factorized a minimim possible and can be applied to different datasets.

##Algorithms

###Preprocessing

-Loads datasets
-Cleans data
-Splits datasets into training and test datasets
-Additionnaly to cleaned data, outputs datasets on which we operated either tsne or PCA


###Classification models comparison


We compare the performance of different models on the test datasets.
The models are: CART, KNN, SVM and Log regression


###Improved Classifiers

Contains following models:
SVM - KNN - Log regression 
Here, we improve our models by looking for the parameters that maximize the accuracy. 
```
Give an example

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
